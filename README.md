👦 Nathan Underwood - Module 5 Challenge

This Challenge gives me the opportunity to refactor previous code in order to build a smooth daily planner tool.

The Daily Planner 📔 project allowed me to showcase my ability to use Javascript, as well as third-party API's such as Bootstrap, Moment, and jQuery. I initially struggled on the functionality of saving 💾 appointments in individual timeslots without creating excess code. I enjoyed coming up with the most efficient ⏩ way possible (with my current ability) of dynamically stylizing the timeblock background according to time of day, and storing user-input into local storage. I imagine there is a more efficient way of of adding user-input to local storage than creating nine separate event-listeners, and am excited ❕ to research  ways to accomplish this. 

📼 Here is a short video of what the functioning webpage should look like: <img src= "https://github.com/thundernunder/module-5-challenge/blob/main/Assets/daily-planner-functionality.gif" alt="Daily Planner Runthrough">
