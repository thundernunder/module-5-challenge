👦 Nathan Underwood - Module 5 Challenge

This Challenge gives me the opportunity to refactor previous code in order to build a smooth daily planner tool.

Building this quiz showcases my ability to use event listeners 👂, timer intervals ⏰, store user information 💾, and more to create a smooth user experience. We've been told in class to "think like a programmer", and I believe the Javascript code in this project shows me starting to take in what that means. The end-user reads top-to-bottom 📗, but a programmer's code should reflect when functionality is firing 🚀 and events are happening. Building code like this makes it easier for the next person to understand what's going on. 

📼 Here is a short video of what the functioning webpage should look like: <img src= "https://github.com/thundernunder/module-4-challenge/blob/main/assets/coding-quiz.gif" alt="Coding Quiz Runthrough">
